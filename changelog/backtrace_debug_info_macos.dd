Filenames and line numbers have been added to stacktraces on macOS

When an exception is throw and not caught, a stacktrace is printed. On Linux,
FreeBSD and DragonFlyBSD this stacktrace includes the filenames and line numbers,
if the application was built with debug info enabled. This feature has now been
added to macOS.

This requires support from the compiler since debug info is stripped by the
linker on macOS.

Example:

---
void bar()
{
    throw new Exception("bar");
}

void foo()
{
    bar();
}

void main()
{
    foo();
}
---

Compiling the above code, with debug info enabled, by running: `dmd -g main.d`.
When running the application it will produce an output similar to:

$(CONSOLE
object.Exception@main.d(3): bar
main.d:3 void main.bar() [0x71afdfb]
main.d:8 void main.foo() [0x71afe0c]
main.d:13 _Dmain [0x71afd78]
)
